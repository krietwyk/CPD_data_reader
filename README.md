# CPD_data_reader
A simple script is a simple gui for visualising and interpolating CPD 
measurementsperformed on a KP Technology scanning Kelvin probe. The script
interpolates 2D grids of uniform spacing using an inverse distance approach.

Data can be opened directly from a file or as a tab-delimited array using
the input array text box and button.
